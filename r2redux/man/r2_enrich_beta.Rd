\title{r2_enrich_beta}
\usage{
r2_enrich_beta(dat, v1, v2, nv, exp1)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{N by (M+1) matrix having variables in the order of cbind(y,x)}

\item{nv}{sample size}

\item{exp1}{The expectation of the ratio (e.g. ratio of # SNPs in genomic partitioning)}

\item{v1/v2}{These can be set as v1=1 and v2=2, v1=2 and v2=1, v1=3 and v2=2, or any combination as long as the value is between 1 - M}
}
\description{
This function estimates var(t1/(t1+t2))
where t1 = beta1^2 and t2 = beta2^2, and
beta1 and 2 are regression coefficients from a multiple regression model,
i.e. y = x1•beta1 + x2•beta2 + e, where y, x1 and x2 are column-standardised
(see Olkin and Finn 1995).
y is N by 1 matrix having the dependent variable, and
x1 is N by 1 matrix having the ith explanatory variables.
x2 is N by 1 matrix having the jth explanatory variables.
v1 and v2 indicates the ith and jth column in the data
(v1 or v2 should be a single interger between 1 - M, see Arguments below).
Note that r2_enrich (above) and r2_enrich_beta is equivalent (identical p-value derived).
}
\examples{
To get the test statistic for the ratio which is significantly
different from the expectation.
var(t1/(t1+t2)), where t1 = beta1^2 and t2 = beta2^2.
beta1 and beta2 are regression coefficients from a multiple regression model,
i.e. y = x1•beta1 + x2•beta2 + e, where y, x1 and x2 are column-standardised
