# r2redux
The r2redux package will be used to test the significant difference between two PRS. We use predictive ability (R^2) measures and their variance covariance matrix to assess if the predictive ability of PRS based on different sources is significantly different to each other. 

# INSTALLATION
To use r2redux:
-install.packages("devtools")
-install.packages("r2redux")
-library(devtools)
-library(r2redux)
